## types of Design Patterns
There are Three different types of design Patterns.

### 1. Structural Design Pattern - MVC, MVVM etc
### 2 Behavioral Design Pattern - Delegation, Observer etc
### 3 Creational Design Pattern - Singleton, Builders etc

## Things to Keep in Mind
- Do NOT overuse design Patterns as they make app more complex
- Define the problem for the better solution
- Design Patterns aren't concrete patterns, yet a starting point

## Reading Class of Diagram

Class Diagram is class, protocol, methods, properties and relationships.
When inheriting from another class, they aren't 'Inherited' but 'is a' another class.
Thus an iPhone 'is a' phone. Not that iPhone 'inherits a' phone.
